* the coordinator may or not exist
** that is why the coordinator id can be nullable
*** if more than one, the groups will receive an alpha numbering, i.e.: a, b .. z
**** group_id might be duplicated in the class entity in the mongo implementation - To avoid that you can use promise all to add the info in the controllers to the payload
