Back end:

// Todo --> move from end of the page exports to inline exports
// Todo --> check if the empty just toBeCalled are necessary since you already have toBeCalledWith that might replace it
// Todo --> type the entities params when need it instead of comments with params types, maybe use zod
// Todo --> make sure populate does not go into production
// Todo --> check how the soft delete of the school affects other entities controllers
// Todo --> simplify the error messages, do not send the entire message in production, make the more user-friendly
// Todo --> add success confirmation boolean in the response message
// Todo --> refactor the test to not be attached to the implementation but the results, maybe use in-memory-mongo-db or something similar

for later:

- authentication JWT
- authorization - role base
    https://youtu.be/0NiyW9XINRA?feature=shared
- add checks for the school, make sure the field actually belongs to the school  - school middleware
- make sure resources belong to the user/coordinator's school - school middleware
- not allow user/coordinator to update/delete other user/coordinator's info - coordinator middleware


- add csrf attack protection features:

- important: try to update packages, specially express validator,
- continue checking sanitization and overall security of the apis


Front End

// Todo --> if user is UPDATED as inactive being soft deleted, inform the user that the user functions must be passed onto a new teacher
// Todo --> if the level changes in the group, inform the user that the user must change it in the session
// Todo --> Create the user first then create the teacher, do that on a kind of multi-step form, alternatively, you can also use promise.all to do it in one step


for later:
