Back end:
// Todo --> controllers, tests, validators, and routes labeling might not be scalable
// Todo --> type the entities params when need it instead of comments with params types
// Todo --> refactor the test to not be attached to the implementation but the results, maybe use in-memory-mongo-db or something similar
// Todo --> make sure populate does not go into production, maybe work on a file to be call on the terminal
// Todo --> fix the issue with the ESmodules modules, maybe try something different from ts-node
// Todo --> add prettier config and linter
// Todo --> important: try to update packages; specially express validator, maybe use zod
// Todo --> add csrf attack protection features:

// Todo --> authentication JWT
// Todo --> authorization - role base

// Todo -->add checks for the school, make sure the field actually belongs to the school  - school middleware
// Todo --> on update check how the soft delete of the school affects other entities controllers, maybe just update users status
// Todo --> make sure resources belong to the user/coordinator's school - school middleware
// Todo --> not allow user/coordinator to update/delete other user/coordinator's info - coordinator middleware

Front End

// Todo --> if user is UPDATED as inactive being soft deleted, inform the user that the user functions must be passed onto a new teacher
// Todo --> Create the user first then create the teacher, do that on a kind of multi-step form, alternatively, you can also use promise.all to do it in one step


for later:
